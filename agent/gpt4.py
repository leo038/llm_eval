Claim: Paramore is not from Tennessee.
output: 
Thought 1: I should search for information on Paramore and their origins to determine if they are from Tennessee.
Action 1: Search[Paramore]
Observation 1: Paramore is an American rock band formed in 2004 in Franklin, Tennessee. The group originally consisted of lead vocalist Hayley Williams, guitarist Jason Bynum, and bassist Josh Farro. 

Thought 2: Since the observation states that Paramore was formed in Franklin, Tennessee, it indicates that they are indeed from Tennessee.

Action 2: Finish[REFUTES]
